Alright, let's break down the concept of "Appeal to Consequences" using Chrono Trigger, which is such a fun way to explore this! Imagine you're chilling with Crono and the gang, time-traveling and having a blast.

So, the Appeal to Consequences is like when someone decides whether something is true or false based on whether the outcome is good or bad, rather than on the actual evidence or logic. It's like if Marle said, "If we believe that Lavos can be defeated, then the future will be bright and happy. Therefore, Lavos can definitely be defeated." She's basing the truth of defeating Lavos on the positive outcome, not on whether they actually have the strength or strategy to pull it off.

In Chrono Trigger, this dilemma pops up in interesting ways. Think about the moment when you have to decide whether to confront Magus or not. An appeal to consequences would be like saying, "If we beat Magus, then the future will be safe from Lavos. Therefore, Magus must be the source of all our problems." This ignores the complex reality of the situation and the fact that Magus's relationship with Lavos isn't so straightforward.

The key here is to remember that just because we want something to be true because it leads to a good outcome (or false because it leads to a bad one), doesn't make it actually true. It's a bit like betting all your G on a race in the Millennial Fair based solely on the hope that your chosen racer will make you happy by winning, not on their actual track record or abilities.

So, when you're navigating the challenges with Crono and friends, think about how you're deciding what's true or what to do. Are you looking at the evidence and thinking it through, or are you letting the potential consequences cloud your judgment? That's the essence of tackling the appeal to consequences dilemma, even when time-traveling!

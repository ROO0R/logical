Alrighty, let's chat about the Appeal to Novelty fallacy using "Chrono Trigger," a classic RPG, as our guiding star. Imagine you're chillin' with Crono and the gang, time-traveling and adventuring through different eras. Now, imagine someone arguing that because something is newer or more recent, it's automatically better than anything older. That's the Appeal to Novelty fallacy in a nutshell.

In "Chrono Trigger," you hop between different time periods, from the prehistoric age to the far future. If we fell for the Appeal to Novelty fallacy, we might say that the future technology you encounter, like Robo or the Epoch (your time machine), is inherently better in every way simply because it's newer. It's like saying, "Hey, this future stuff must be the best because it's the latest and greatest, right?"

But here's where it gets interesting: the game shows us that newer isn't always better. For example, despite all the advanced technology in the future, the world is in ruins, and humanity is struggling to survive. Meanwhile, in earlier times, like in the medieval era with Frog or the prehistoric age with Ayla, there are strengths and values that the future lacks, despite its technological advancements.

So, the game itself is a fantastic counterargument to the Appeal to Novelty. It teaches us that newness doesn't automatically equal superiority. Each era has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and blindly favoring the latest thing without considering its actual value or the context can lead us astray. Just like how each member of your team from different times has their own unique skills and contributions, regardless of when they're from.

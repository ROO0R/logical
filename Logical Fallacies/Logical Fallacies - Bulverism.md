Alright, imagine you're playing *Chrono Trigger,* that classic RPG where you hop around in time saving the world. Now, Bulverism is like if you were arguing with someone about whether Frog, one of the game's characters, should use the Masamune sword or not. Instead of discussing the sword's stats or Frog's abilities, you just go, "You only think the Masamune is bad because you're bad at strategy games."

So, Bulverism skips the whole debate about the actual issue and jumps straight to assuming the other person's opinion is wrong because of some personal flaw or bias they have. It's like saying, "You're only siding with Magus because you always root for the bad guys," without actually discussing Magus's motivations or actions in the game. It shortcuts logical discussion with a sort of character attack.

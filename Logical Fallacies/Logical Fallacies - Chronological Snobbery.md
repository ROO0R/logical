Alright, let's dive into "chronological snobbery" using Chrono Trigger, a classic video game where time travel plays a crucial role, as our guide. Imagine you're part of Chrono's gang, hopping between different eras, from prehistoric times to a post-apocalyptic future.

Chronological snobbery is like when someone in the game thinks that their own time period is the best or most important, just because it's the latest one in the timeline they know. It's like Marle, Lucca, or Crono dismissing the wisdom of the mystics or the folks in 600 A.D. simply because those people haven't invented robots or don't know what a television is. Or like us, in the present day, thinking less of past civilizations because they didn't have smartphones or the internet.

This dilemma gets juicy in Chrono Trigger because the game itself challenges this notion big time. As you adventure through different epochs, you learn that each era has its own knowledge, wisdom, and technology that are crucial for solving the game's overarching problems. The folks in 2300 A.D. have advanced tech, but they've lost a lot of the "heart" and connection to nature that characters in 65,000,000 B.C. have in spades.

So, calling something "chronological snobbery" is like telling someone they're being narrow-minded for thinking newer automatically means better, without appreciating the value and lessons from the past. Just like how Chrono and his friends find strengths and learn lessons from each era to save their world, we can see the value in past ideas, cultures, and knowledge to enrich our lives and solve today's problems.

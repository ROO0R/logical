Alright, let's dive into circular reasoning, and I'll bring in some Chrono Trigger to help make it all clear. Circular reasoning is like going in a loop. Imagine you're in the game Chrono Trigger, and you're on a quest to prove that your friend, Marle, is a princess. If someone asked you, "Why do you believe Marle is a princess?" and you said, "Because she looks like a princess," and then they followed up with, "And how do you know what a princess looks like?" and you replied, "Because she looks like Marle," you're running in circles. You're using the conclusion (Marle is a princess) as the reason for itself without providing any outside evidence.

In Chrono Trigger, you travel through time, and actions in one time period can affect what happens in another. Imagine if you tried to justify a decision in the game by saying, "I'm doing this because I saw it in the future," and then you justified what happens in the future by saying, "It happened because I did it in the past." Without any external reason why the first action is taken, you're caught in a time loop, much like circular reasoning.

To break out of this loop in an argument (or in Chrono Trigger), you need external evidence or reasons. Like finding a royal crest in Marle's belongings or learning about her lineage from the game's lore, these pieces of information come from outside the loop and help provide solid grounding for your claims. In arguments, as in time-travel adventures, relying solely on what's within the loop gets you nowhere; stepping outside of it is what moves you forward.

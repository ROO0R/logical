Alright, think about Chrono Trigger, that classic RPG game where you hop around in time, fighting baddies and saving the world. Now, let’s use it to explain the Division Fallacy, where you assume what's true for a whole group must also be true for each individual part of that group.

Imagine Chrono and his team. They're a strong bunch together, right? They've got magic, swords, and all kinds of skills. When they team up, they can take down big bosses and save the future. But saying because their team can beat a boss, then Crono alone, without his pals, can also beat the boss just because he's part of that kick-butt team, well, that's the Division Fallacy. It’s like saying, “Hey, Crono is part of this amazing group, so obviously, he can do everything the group can do by himself!” Nope, not necessarily true. Crono’s great, but some challenges need the whole gang.

To break it down: Just because the whole team of Chrono Trigger is strong together, doesn't mean each character by themselves can handle the same threats or tasks with the same efficiency. Each member brings something unique to the table, and their combined strength is what makes them powerful, not the individual abilities alone.

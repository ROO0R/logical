Alright, let's dive into the "Fallacy Fallacy" using "Chrono Trigger," an iconic RPG game, as a reference. Imagine you're playing "Chrono Trigger," journeying through time with Chrono and his friends, facing various challenges and making decisions that impact the game's outcome.

The "Fallacy Fallacy" sounds like a funny term, but it's actually a common mistake in reasoning. It happens when you conclude that just because someone's argument contains a fallacy, their conclusion must be wrong. Think of it like this: during your adventures in "Chrono Trigger," you might come across a character who presents a shaky argument for why you should take a certain action, like "Everyone in the future uses this technique to defeat enemies, so it must be the best strategy." This reasoning is flawed because popularity doesn't necessarily mean something is the best.

Here's where the fallacy fallacy comes in. If you dismiss the strategy solely because the character's argument was weak (fallacious), you might be committing the fallacy fallacy. Just because their argument was poorly constructed doesn't mean the strategy itself isn't effective. In "Chrono Trigger," you learn that exploring all options and understanding the nuances of each character and strategy is crucial for success. Similarly, in logical reasoning, it's important to assess the conclusion on its own merits, not just dismiss it because the argument was flawed.

So, applying this to "Chrono Trigger": let's say a character argues that you should use a particular weapon because "it's the most ancient weapon we've found so far, and ancient things are always better." This argument is fallacious because being ancient doesn't automatically make something better (appeal to antiquity fallacy). However, if you conclude the weapon is useless solely based on the poor reasoning, without testing or considering its attributes, you're falling into the fallacy fallacy. The weapon might actually be incredibly powerful in certain situations. 

In summary, the fallacy fallacy teaches us not to throw out potentially good ideas just because they're presented with bad arguments. Just like in "Chrono Trigger," where exploration, experimentation, and critical thinking lead to success, in logical reasoning, it's important to assess each conclusion on its own merits, beyond the flaws in how it's argued.

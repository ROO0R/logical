Alright, diving into Ignoratio Elenchi with a sprinkle of Chrono Trigger for flavor, imagine you're on a quest with Crono and the gang. Your big mission is to stop the world from ending, right? Now, imagine you're in the middle of a heated debate with Magus about whether Lavos is the root cause of the world's impending doom.

**Ignoratio Elenchi,** or missing the point, is like if during that debate, Magus suddenly starts arguing about how powerful his magic is compared to Crono's sword skills. Interesting? Sure. Relevant to whether Lavos is the main threat? Not at all. Magus has veered off course, focusing on something completely unrelated to the main issue. It's like you're trying to figure out how to defeat Lavos, but now you're stuck arguing about magic versus swordsmanship, which doesn't solve the problem of saving the world.

In the context of Chrono Trigger, it would be crucial to stay focused on the main goal (stopping Lavos) rather than getting sidetracked by secondary arguments (who's the stronger fighter). That's Ignoratio Elenchi in a nutshell, diverting the conversation from the real issue to something else entirely.

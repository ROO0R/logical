Okay, let's dive into the concept of an "Incomplete Comparison" using *Chrono Trigger*, a classic RPG game that's all about adventures through time, as our guide. Imagine you're in the world of Chrono Trigger, where you can jump from one era to another, meet all sorts of characters, and face various challenges.

An "Incomplete Comparison" happens when someone makes a comparison between two things, but they don't give you enough information to understand the comparison fully. It's like saying one character is stronger than another without specifying in what way. 

Now, let's say you're comparing the strength of Crono, the game's protagonist, with Magus, one of the powerful characters you encounter. If I just say, "Crono is stronger than Magus," that's an incomplete comparison. Why? Because I haven't told you what kind of strength I'm talking about. Are we talking about physical strength? Magical power? The ability to gather allies? The comparison is incomplete because it lacks the context needed to understand it fully.

In the context of *Chrono Trigger*, this is like saying the future is better than the past without explaining why. Is it because of technology? Social progress? It's an incomplete comparison because it leaves out crucial details that would help you understand the comparison in depth. 

To avoid making an incomplete comparison, we need to be clear about the criteria we're using for our comparison. So, if I say, "Crono is stronger than Magus in terms of physical strength, because he can deal more damage with his sword attacks," that's a complete comparison. It gives you the specific context (physical strength) and why one is considered stronger than the other (sword attack damage).

So, next time you're traversing through the eras in *Chrono Trigger* or making comparisons in real life, remember to include all the necessary details to avoid the pitfall of incomplete comparisons!

Alright, think of a loaded question like this: it's a question that's rigged from the start, much like being trapped in one of those unwinnable battles in Chrono Trigger. You know, the kind where the game's storyline puts you up against an enemy you're not meant to beat, but you still have to fight it. The question assumes something right off the bat that might not be true, and it puts you in a tight spot because answering it directly can make you look bad or admit to something you didn't do.

Let's use Chrono Trigger for a more vivid picture. Imagine you're in the Kingdom of Guardia, and someone asks Marle, "Why did you decide to steal the pendant from the market?" This is a loaded question because it assumes Marle stole the pendant, even though, in reality, she didn't; she merely lost it, and Crono found it. Answering this question is tricky because if Marle tries to defend herself by saying she didn't steal it, she's still engaging with the idea that she did something wrong in the first place.

The dilemma with a loaded question is similar to facing Lavos too early in the game. You're put in a situation where the odds are against you, and it feels like there's no right way to fight back. The best approach, much like finding a clever strategy in a tough Chrono Trigger battle, is to question the premise itself or dodge the built-in assumption. Marle could say, "That's not what happened. Let me tell you the real story," which is like finding an unexpected tactic to turn the battle in your favor without directly confronting the overwhelming force head-on.

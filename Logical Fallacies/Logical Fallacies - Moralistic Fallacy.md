Alright, let's dive into the moralistic fallacy using "Chrono Trigger," a classic RPG, as our guide. The moralistic fallacy is the reasoning error that occurs when one assumes that the way things should be is the way things are. It's like wishing the world worked according to our moral compass or ideals and mistakenly believing it actually does.

In "Chrono Trigger," you've got a bunch of characters fighting to prevent a disastrous future where the world is devastated. Now, let's use this setting to explain the moralistic fallacy. 

Imagine if our heroes, Crono and his friends, believed that because their cause was just and moral (saving the world from destruction), their success was guaranteed - as if the universe would just bend to their will because they're the "good guys." That's the moralistic fallacy in a nutshell: believing that because their goal is morally right, everything will naturally align to make it happen. 

But as players of "Chrono Trigger" know, success isn't handed to Crono and the gang just because they're on the right side of morality. They have to fight, strategize, and sometimes even manipulate time itself to achieve their goals. The universe (or the game's world) doesn't care about their moral stance; their success depends on their actions, not the moral righteousness of their cause.

So, applying this to the real world, the moralistic fallacy might lead someone to believe that good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people, because that's how things should work, morally speaking. However, life is more complex, and morality doesn't dictate the laws of nature or human behavior. Just like in "Chrono Trigger," outcomes depend on a complex interplay of actions, choices, and circumstances, not on the moral righteousness of the individuals involved.

Alright, let's dive into the "No True Scotsman" fallacy, keeping it simple and using "Chrono Trigger," a classic RPG game, as our guide.

Imagine you're chilling in the Kingdom of Guardia, and you and your buddy, who's a huge fan of Lucca (the genius inventor of the group), get into a chat. You mention that all of Lucca's inventions work perfectly. But then, I remind you of that time her teleportation device kinda went haywire and teleported Crono (the protagonist) into a whole different time period. That was not exactly "working perfectly," right?

Here's where the "No True Scotsman" fallacy kicks in. Instead of admitting that Lucca's inventions can sometimes flop, your buddy goes, "Well, any invention that doesn't work perfectly isn't a true Lucca invention."

Sounds a bit off, doesn't it? That's because your friend just moved the goalposts to keep their initial statement true in their eyes, despite clear evidence to the contrary. This fallacy is about excluding counterexamples from a generalization to save the generalization rather than adjusting the generalization to fit the new evidence.

"No True Scotsman" happens when someone makes a broad claim. Then, when presented with an example that contradicts their claim, they basically cheat by redefining the terms to exclude that specific counterexample. It's like saying, "No true hero would flee from battle," and then when you hear about a hero who did flee for a good reason, saying, "Ah, but no true hero would flee for that reason."

In the context of "Chrono Trigger," if someone claimed "All heroes from Guardia never make mistakes," and then you bring up Crono's accidental trip through time as a mistake, they might retort with, "Well, any true hero of Guardia who makes a mistake was doing it for the greater good, so it doesn't count." See? They just pulled a "No True Scotsman" by tweaking the definition to keep their original statement intact. 

So, the fallacy is a way of denying or avoiding counterexamples to a claim by changing the rules or criteria after the fact, much like trying to argue that every single one of Lucca's inventions must be flawless, even when faced with clear examples of them going awry.

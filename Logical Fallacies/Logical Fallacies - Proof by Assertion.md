Alright, let's dive into "Proof by Assertion" using "Chrono Trigger" as our guiding star. In "Chrono Trigger," a classic RPG, you're thrown into a world of time travel, where actions in one era can dramatically alter the future. Imagine if, in this game, you keep insisting that simply by defeating a minor enemy, you'll ultimately save the world, no matter what else happens. This insistence, without further evidence or taking into account the complexities of the game's world, is similar to Proof by Assertion in real life.

Proof by Assertion is like stubbornly claiming that "Robo," one of your party members, can defeat the final boss alone, just because he's a cool robot with some neat abilities. You assert this over and over, despite not examining how his abilities actually stack up against the boss's, or considering the strategic depth required to win such a battle.

In the context of "Chrono Trigger," where your actions across different time periods can have vast, unpredictable consequences, asserting something repeatedly without proper evidence is especially risky. It ignores the game's intricate cause-and-effect mechanics, much like ignoring real-world complexity and evidence in an argument.

So, in essence, Proof by Assertion is like saying, "If I keep doing this one thing in 'Chrono Trigger,' I'll win," regardless of the game's depth and how actions interconnect across time. It's a refusal to engage with the broader, more complex reality, whether we're talking about navigating a video game or debating real-world issues.

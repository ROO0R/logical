Alright, let's dive into the concept of "quoting out of context" using "Chrono Trigger," a beloved classic video game, as our guide to make things clearer and more relatable. 

**What is Quoting Out of Context?**

Quoting out of context is like taking a single line of dialogue from "Chrono Trigger" without any of the surrounding story or character development. Imagine a scene where a character says something dramatic like "I'll destroy it!" Without context, it sounds like this character might be the villain, planning to wreak havoc. But, if you've played "Chrono Trigger," you know that the story is rich and the characters' motivations are deep and complex. Maybe that line is actually from Crono or another hero, talking about destroying a machine that's threatening the world. The meaning changes entirely when you know the full story.

**Chrono Trigger Example**

Think about Chrono, the silent protagonist. If I took a scene where Chrono is about to break something important (without telling you why), and presented it as if he's a reckless character, I'd be ignoring his heroic intentions. Throughout the game, Chrono and his friends travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe. Their actions, including breaking things, are often in pursuit of this noble goal.

So, quoting out of context is like showing someone a snapshot of Chrono swinging his sword at something and saying, "Look at this dangerous character!" without explaining he's actually saving the world. It's misleading because it strips away the rich narrative and character development that justify his actions.

**Why It's a Dilemma**

This becomes a dilemma because it can be used to manipulate opinions or spread misinformation, intentionally or not. In discussions, debates, or media, quoting out of context can drastically alter perceptions, like making a hero seem like a villain. It's a reminder of the importance of understanding the full story or argument before forming an opinion, much like understanding a character's full journey in "Chrono Trigger" before judging their actions.

Just like in "Chrono Trigger," where every action and event is part of a larger, intricate storyline, every quote or piece of information is part of a larger context. Removing that context can change the meaning entirely, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.

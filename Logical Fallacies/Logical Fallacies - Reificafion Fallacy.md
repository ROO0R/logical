Alright, diving into the reification fallacy with a touch of Chrono Trigger to make things clearer. The reification fallacy occurs when you treat something abstract, like happiness or time, as if it were a concrete, real thing you could touch or see. It’s like imagining you could put time in a bottle or catch happiness with a net.

In Chrono Trigger, a classic RPG game, time is treated almost like a place you can visit. You can jump into different eras, from the prehistoric age to the distant future, using a time machine called the Epoch. Now, while this is super cool and makes for an amazing game, it’s a bit of a reification fallacy in action. Time, in the real world, isn’t a destination or a tangible thing; it’s a concept we use to understand change and the sequence of events.

So, if someone in the real world said, “I’m going to travel back in time to see the dinosaurs,” as if time were a place on a map, that’s falling into the reification fallacy. Chrono Trigger lets us play with the idea of time as something we can navigate and manipulate, which is part of its charm, but it’s a great example of how the reification fallacy works in storytelling and games. We love the idea, but it’s taking an abstract concept and giving it physical properties it doesn’t really have.

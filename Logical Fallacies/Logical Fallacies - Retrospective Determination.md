Alright, let's break down the concept of "retrospective determination" using "Chrono Trigger," a classic RPG game, as our example. At level 3 verbosity, I'll keep it straightforward but informative.

Retrospective determination is like looking back in time to judge decisions or events based on their outcomes or the information we have now, which wasn't available back then. It's like playing Monday morning quarterback but with history or personal decisions.

In "Chrono Trigger," your characters travel through time, affecting events in the past to change the future. Let's say you're in the future and see that the world is in ruins. You then travel back in time to stop the disaster from happening. The dilemma kicks in when you have to decide whether your actions in the past were "right" or "effective" based on the future you come from or the new future you create.

The logical dilemma here is like questioning if the decisions made by Crono and his friends were correct based on the information they had at the time or the outcomes seen after changing something in the past. For instance, saving Chrono Trigger's world from Lavos feels like the right call because of the dire state of the future. But from the perspective of someone in the past, without knowledge of Lavos or the future, the actions of Crono's party might seem confusing, unnecessary, or even harmful.

So, the dilemma is about the fairness and validity of judging past actions with the luxury of hindsight. It's tricky because people or characters make decisions based on what they know at the moment, not what will be known in the future. In "Chrono Trigger," this plays out as the characters navigate their decisions and their impacts across different timelines, always with the goal of a better future but often with the uncertainty of whether their interventions are "right" in the grand scheme of things.

In summary, retrospective determination challenges us to consider how fair or logical it is to judge past decisions based on outcomes or information only available later. Using "Chrono Trigger" helps illustrate how complex and nuanced such judgments can be, especially when time travel throws a wrench into our understanding of cause and effect.

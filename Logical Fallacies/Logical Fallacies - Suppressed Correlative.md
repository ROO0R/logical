Alright, diving into the concept of the Suppressed Correlative using "Chrono Trigger" as our guiding star, let's simplify this dilemma. In "Chrono Trigger," a classic RPG, you travel through time to change the course of history, encountering various choices along the way. 

Now, imagine in "Chrono Trigger," you're given a choice between "good" and "evil" actions, but the game decides to redefine "good" to mean "whatever the protagonist, Crono, does." This twist narrows the definition of "good" so much that it doesn't really leave room for "evil" to be a genuine choice. It's like saying your only transportation options are "a time machine" or "not a time machine," but then defining "time machine" as "any possible way to travel." Suddenly, "not a time machine" isn't really a choice, because everything has been classified as a "time machine."

The Suppressed Correlative dilemma happens when a debate or choice gets skewed because the definitions of the options are manipulated or restricted. It's like if in "Chrono Trigger," the game only lets you see actions that benefit Crono's team as "heroic," while ignoring or minimizing the heroism in other characters' choices or paths. The game has "suppressed" the correlative, or comparative, nature of "heroism" by limiting what can be considered heroic.

So, in a nutshell, when talking about Suppressed Correlative, we're looking at how defining terms in a biased or narrow way can unfairly limit our choices or understanding of a situation. Just like how "Chrono Trigger" could potentially frame its narrative to make Crono's journey the only "right" path, by controlling how we view what's "good" or "heroic."
